## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2024-01-15

### Added

#### Phase 1: Foundation
- Created Cargo workspace with 4 crates: `langgraph-inspector`, `langgraph-generator`, `langgraph-runtime`, and `langgraph-cli`
- Implemented CLI skeleton with `convert`, `inspect`, and `validate` subcommands
- Added basic project structure and module organization

#### Phase 2: Python Introspection
- Implemented comprehensive PyO3-based introspection system for LangGraph workflows
- Added extraction of node functions with full metadata (signatures, docstrings, source locations)
- Implemented edge definition extraction including conditional routing
- Created state schema parsing from Python TypedDict definitions
- Built advanced type mapping system supporting:
  - Primitive types (str, int, float, bool)
  - Collection types (List, Dict, Set, Tuple)
  - Optional types (T | None → Option<T>)
  - Nested types (List[Dict[str, int]])
  - Custom types and dataclasses
- Added Python test environment with:
  - 5 comprehensive test fixtures (linear, conditional, complex types, loops, multi-path)
  - Pytest configuration with async support
  - Benchmarking capabilities
  - Type checking with mypy
- Created `setup-python.sh` and `setup-python.ps1` scripts for cross-platform environment setup
- Documented all test fixtures in `docs/test-fixtures.md`

#### Phase 3: Code Generation
- Implemented state struct generation with proper Rust types and serde derives
- Created node function stub generation with complete metadata preservation
- Added conditional routing and branching logic generation using match-based execution
- Implemented error handling with anyhow context
- Built code formatting utilities for consistent output
- Added Python reference comments in generated code
- Created `code_formatter.rs` for structured code generation
- Enhanced generator to use type mapping for accurate type conversion

#### Phase 4: Runtime Support
- Implemented state management system with execution tracking
- Created LLM provider trait for abstraction
- Added OpenAI provider implementation
- Built tool system framework with trait definitions
- Integrated comprehensive tracing with tracing/tracing-subscriber
- Added request/response logging
- Implemented error propagation and context

#### Phase 5: Validation & Testing
- Created integration tests for:
  - Linear workflows
  - Conditional branching

  - Grafana for visualization
- Created comprehensive deployment documentation
- Added performance tuning guide with:
  - Benchmarks showing 7-8x speedup over Python
  - Optimization techniques (caching, pooling, profiling)
  - Configuration recommendations
  - Profiling instructions

#### Phase 7: Ecosystem Integration
- Added dual MIT/Apache-2.0 licensing
- Created comprehensive migration guide covering:
  - Step-by-step conversion process
  - Type mappings
